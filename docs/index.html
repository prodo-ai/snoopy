          <h2>üèÅ Run Snoopy.</h2>

          <p>To give it a quick try, you can run it with <code>npx</code>:</p>

          <p class="code">
            <code>
              <span class="shell">npx @prodo-ai/snoopy</span>
            </code>
          </p>

          <p>
            When you're serious, just add it as a dependency to your project (so
            it'll run immediately, every time):
          </p>

          <p class="code">
            <code>
              <span class="shell">npm install --save-dev @prodo-ai/snoopy</span
              ><br />
              <span class="shell">./node_modules/.bin/snoopy</span>
            </code>
          </p>

          <h2>üìö Check out the docs.</h2>

          <p>
            The docs are pretty lean right now, as things are changing fast, but
            it should get you up and running.
          </p>

          <p class="statement">
            <a href="https://github.com/prodo-ai/snoopy"

        <section>
          <h2>üö§ Unreasonably fast.</h2>

          <p>
            Snoopy gets things done. When you hit
            <span class="instruction">üíæ Save</span>, everything gets updated
            instantly. No more waiting for Webpack to get around to it.
          </p>

          <p>
            And because you're looking at every component, you don't need to
            click around to get things into the correct state. They're already
            there.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>ü§ñ All the information you need.</h2>

          <p>
            Computers were made to compute. Snoopy renders everything you've got
            every time you change anything, giving you
            <strong>all the information you need</strong> to make quick
            decisions.
          </p>

        <section>
          <h2>üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Zero-config.</h2>

          <p>
            Everything works out of the box.
            <strong>You don't need to configure anything</strong> to get Snoopy
            running and rendering your components. All you need to do is make a
            few examples.
          </p>

          <p>Soon, you won't even need to do that.</p>

          <p>
            Snoopy already finds your components for you. Soon it'll be able to
            analyse the way you interact with them in order to infer the kinds
            of properties those components need, and
            <strong>provide those properties automatically</strong>.
          </p>

          <p>
            This means you won't have to design your examples up-front. You'll
            just let Snoopy think a few things up, and then tweak to suit your
            needs.
          </p>

          <h2>
            üì∏ Testing is boring.
          </h2>

          <p class="coming-soon">(Coming Soon)</p>

          <p>
            Once you're happy with your design, let the machine double-check it
            for you.
          </p>

          <p>
            When it comes to design and front-end development, we're not so much
            looking for "this is right" as <strong>"this feels right"</strong>.
            Typical development best practices often don't apply.
          </p>

          <p>
            In the near future, Snoopy will
            <strong>take snapshots of your component examples</strong>, and make
            sure that whenever your design diverges from what you expect, you'll
            be notified.
          </p>

          <p>
            And because it can check each component individually, it can work
            quickly and effectively.

          <h2>ü§π‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è State management is hard.</h2>

          <p class="coming-soon">(Coming Soon)</p>

          <p>
            Your UI has so much state that bugs are inevitable. Figuring out
            what's going on at any given moment is nigh-on impossible.
            <strong
              >And diagnosing bugs found by your users is even worse.</strong
            >
          </p>

          <p>
            In the future, Snoopy will help you with this, making sure that you
            can always track the series of events that got you into a particular
            state, without the overhead of conventional approaches.
          </p>

          <p>
            And we're going to make it more fun, too. üòâ
