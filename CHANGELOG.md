# CHANGELOG

## 0.2.0 - _2019-05-24_

- Renamed `@prodo` annotations to `@snoopy`
- React components are found automatically. It is not necessary to have an
  annotation above the export anymore.
- UI has been redesigned. Files can be checked on the sidebar and all components
  in checked files now show on the same page.
- Improve performance of file watcher.
